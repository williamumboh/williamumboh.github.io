I am particularly interested in approximation and online algorithms for optimisation problems involving graphs and metric spaces. One of the main themes in my research is bridging the theory and practice of optimisation under uncertainty. Recently, I have started collaborating with colleagues outside of theoretical computer science to improve the use of algorithms in specific real-world settings such as ride-sharing.</p> <p>I am passionate about sharing the joy of algorithmic problem-solving with students of all levels. I am incredibly grateful to have supervised 7 wonderful Honours students, 6 of whom have received the University Medal, and to have co-authored 2 papers (1 at ICALP 2022 and 1 at SODA 2023) with them. Since 2019, I have been the unit coordinator and lecturer for the third-year algorithms unit COMP3027 and its advanced version COMP3927. I have been awarded the Faculty Unit of Study Survey Commendations 4 times for exceptionally high student ratings.</p> <p>Previously, I was a Lecturer in Algorithms at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney. Before that, I was fortunate to be a postdoc with Prof. Nikhil Bansal at TU Eindhoven. I was also a Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (hosted by Yair Bartal) from Oct 2017 - Jan 2018 and a Visiting Postdoc at the Simons Institute for the Algorithms and Uncertainty (Fall 2016) and Fine-Grained Complexity (Fall 2017) programs. I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was blessed to be co-advised by Profs. Shuchi Chawla and Eric Bach. I also have an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, all from UW-Madison.</p> </body></html>
