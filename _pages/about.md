My research is broadly in theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimisation. I am particularly interested in approximation and online algorithms for optimisation problems involving graphs, metric spaces, and submodularity. One of the main themes in my research is bridging the theory and practice of optimisation under uncertainty. Recently, I have started collaborating with colleagues outside of theoretical computer science to improve the use of algorithms in specific real-world settings such as ride-sharing.

Previously, I was a Lecturer in Algorithms and Honours Coordinator at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney. Before that, I was fortunate to be a postdoc with Prof. Nikhil Bansal at TU Eindhoven. I was also a Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (hosted by Yair Bartal) from Oct 2017 - Jan 2018 and a Visiting Postdoc at the Simons Institute for the Algorithms and Uncertainty (Fall 2016) and Fine-Grained Complexity (Fall 2017) programs. I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was blessed to be co-advised by Profs. Shuchi Chawla and Eric Bach. I also have an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, all from UW-Madison.
