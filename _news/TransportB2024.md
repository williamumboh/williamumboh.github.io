New paper in **Transportation Research Part B**: "Freelance drivers with a decline choice: dispatch menus in on-demand mobility services for assortment optimization" with Yue Yang (first author) and Mohsen Ramezani. I am excited by this paper as it's my first paper with non-CS collaborators (coauthors are from Civil Engineering) and we were able to use theory to come up with practical algorithms.
